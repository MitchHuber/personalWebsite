                <h1 class="display-4"> Hi, I'm Mitchell Huber </h1>
                <p> I studied at Central College of Iowa where I gained a bachelor's in business management and computer information systems. I grew up in Temecula and decided to move away to focus on school while being able to play collegiate golf. Moving away was one of the hardest decisions I've made but in retrospect, it may be the best decision I have made. Going to Iowa allowed me to learn and grow as a person. It's taught me that you have to step out of your comfort zone if you want to learn, I feel that I have learned a lot from my time at Central.
                </p>
                <p>During my time at Central, I had the opportunity to work with multiple languages including JavaScript, Python, C, and Java. My last two years at college I focused most of my time on Java, I created a budgeting application during my senior year. The budgeting app utilized multiple data structures and a serializable server. While creating my budgeting app I gained a better understanding of Java and object-oriented design. My most recent internship was within the IT department for a London based company called Hotcourses. There I helped other IT team members by imaging machines that we later rolled out, updating and organizing multiple databases, and other various tasks around the office. I did not only learn the expectations of the IT department, but I also learned how each department communicated and worked alongside each other.
                </p>
                <p>I believe my biggest strength is my work ethic. My work ethic is the reason that I can learn quickly and to deal with adversity when needed. For my work experience, I’m looking for an opportunity where I can make a positive impact and where I can continue to learn
