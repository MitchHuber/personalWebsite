# personalWebsite

 Personal website I created using HTML, CSS, &amp; Bootstrap. It was project0 for
 Harvard's web programming with Python and JavaScript online course.

 There are four main HTML pages which include the main page, Education page, Hobbies
 page, & the about page. There are three additional pages within the Hobbies page which
 are the three photo albums. Each page includes a navbar that links to the other
 pages, and it is collapsible on smaller screens.

 There is an unordered list on the hobbies page, a table on the education page,
 and multiple images throughout the website. I included one stylesheet for all
 pages, and within that stylesheet I have met the requirements for CSS, ID, class
 selectors, and media queries. I created a couple sass, nested multiple variables,
 and included one instance of inheritance. Each page contain at least one Bootstrap
 component, and each page uses bootstrap's grid model as well.

 The main page includes a jumbotron with text letting you get to know who I am,
 includes links to my github, instagram, linkedin, facebook, and it also
 has a resume button that will allow users to download a copy of my resume.

 The education page has a couple of paragraphs where I describe what i've learned
 throughout the last couple of years and a table showing the programming languages
 i've worked with and for how long.

 The hobbies pages includes some text describing three of my hobbies and has a unordered
 list displaying the hobbies. It also has a card-deck that I used as a way to
 link to photo albums. Each album page includes multiple cars that have a picture
 and description.

 The about page simply shows what I used to create the website.
