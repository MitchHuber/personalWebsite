        <p> I studied at Central college of Iowa for four years. While I was there I gained a bachlor's in business administration
        and compuer information systems. Throughout the years I was able to gain hands on experience with various programming languages which I've included
        in the list to the right. During my last semester, I worked on a desktop budgeting application that utilized Java. By the end of the semester, I had a
        fully functioning application that included features that allowed users to create an account, create budget categories, budget items for each category, just to list a few features.
        I also created a server where I implemented Java's serializable class to allow the server to save information when it shutdown and read in that information on start up to allow users to
        pick up where they previously left off.
        </p>
        <p> During college, I was also able to gain a better understanding of general business practices. I had various courses within various departments including finance, marketing, and accounting.
          I was a part of multiple team projects during my business coursework. The most recent group project I was invloved in was for a marketing research course where our group was tasked with
          reviewing Central's student services through questionnaires responses. With the data from the questionnaires we conducted multiple statistical tests and we offered a suggested action through
          a written report. The knowledge I have gained in my business courses coupled with the courses I have taken for within the computer science department has prepared me for work after college.
