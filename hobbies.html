            <p> I began programming in my freshman year of college. Programming sparked my interest from the very class I enrolled in. My interest for programming
            continues to grow, and I'm excited to see where programming can take me post college.</p>
            <p>
              I recently picked up photography in the last couple of years during my time abroad. I opted to use a film camera in an attempt to learn more about photography
              and how to adjust each setting based on the environment at hand. Some of my albums are included below!

              I began golfing at an early age, my interest in golf started when I would go with my dad. Over the years I was able to play in tournaments throughout highschool, and
              I was able to compete at the college level for Central College. Golf has enstilled me with a storng work ethic since I had to balance being a student-athelete with
              two majors.
